These html webpages were created as resources for the PHYS4121 Laser Physics course.

All html files are stand alone, even the web apps: simply copy the contents of the html folder to a web server
to get the resources to work. index.html is a home page and contains links to all the resources on the site.

The other webpages (airy.html, beer.html, holeBurning.html, and modelocking.html) are interactive web apps
designed to be used as demos in lectures. They run using Javascript that is generated by a Python library 
called Bokeh which is a data visualisation library similar to pyplot but which can produce html
and javascript which allow the plots to be interactive and be modified using UI controls like sliders etc. 
The python files are not needed unless the demos need to be changed or a new one created in the future.

If you wish to change the functionality of the demos themselves then the python files will need to edited and
then run, the source code is located in the python folder (see comments in the python for more information on
how bokeh was used etc.).

Running the python files will then produce a new html file containing the interactive plot but without any of
the additional information, such as headers, navigation bars or descriptions - this needs to be added manually
later (see template.html for an example layout). Running the python files directly may be useful for debugging
the code, but in general the python files should be run using the provided .bat files which will append any
javascript functions and libraries that are needed for the demo to work.
